          Acry for help is hard to resist. This exchange comes from conversations between the AI engineer Blake Lemoine and an AI system called LaMDA (‘Language Model for Dialogue Applications’). Last year, Lemoine leaked the transcript because he genuinely came to believe that LaMDA was sentient – capable of feeling – and in urgent need of protection.

Should he have been more sceptical? Google thought so: they fired him for violation of data security policies, calling his claims ‘wholly unfounded’. If nothing else, though, the case should make us take seriously the possibility that AI systems, in the very near future, will persuade large numbers of users of their sentience. What will happen next? Will we be able to use scientific evidence to allay those fears? If so, what sort of evidence could actually show that an AI is – or is not – sentient?

The question is vast and daunting, and it’s hard to know where to start. But it may be comforting to learn that a group of scientists has been wrestling with a very similar question for a long time. They are ‘comparative psychologists’: scientists of animal minds.

We have lots of evidence that many other animals are sentient beings. It’s not that we have a single, decisive test that conclusively settles the issue, but rather that animals display many different markers of sentience. Markers are behavioural and physiological properties we can observe in scientific settings, and often in our everyday life as well. Their presence in animals can justify our seeing them as having sentient minds. Just as we often diagnose a disease by looking for lots of symptoms, all of which raise the probability of having that disease, so we can look for sentience by investigating many different markers.

This marker-based approach has been most intensively developed in the case of pain. Pain, though only a small part of sentience, has a special ethical significance. It matters a lot. For example, scientists need to show they have taken pain into account, and minimised it as far as possible, to get funding for animal research. So the question of what types of behaviour may indicate pain has been discussed a great deal. In recent years, the debate has concentrated on invertebrate animals like octopuses, crabs and lobsters that have traditionally been left outside the scope of animal welfare laws. The brains of invertebrates are organised very differently from our own, so behavioural markers end up carrying a lot of weight.

Octopuses, crabs and lobsters are now recognised as sentient under UK law

One of the least controversial pain markers is ‘wound tending’ – when an animal nurses and protects an injury until it heals. Another is ‘motivational trade-off’ behaviour, where an animal will change its priorities, abandoning resources it previously found valuable in order to avoid a noxious stimulus – but only when the stimulus becomes severe enough. A third is ‘conditioned place preference’, where an animal becomes strongly averse to a place where it experienced the effects of a noxious stimulus, and strongly favours a place where it could experience the effects of a pain-relieving drug.

These markers are based on what the experience of pain does for us. Pain is that terrible feeling that leads us to nurse our wounds, change our priorities, become averse to things, and value pain relief. When we see the same pattern of responses in an animal, it raises the probability that the animal is experiencing pain too. This type of evidence has shifted opinions about invertebrate animals that have sometimes been dismissed as incapable of suffering. Octopuses, crabs and lobsters are now recognised as sentient under UK law, a move that animal welfare organisations hope to see followed around the world.

Could we use evidence of the same general type to look for sentience in AI? Suppose we were able to create a robot rat that behaves just like a real rat, passing all the same cognitive and behavioural tests. Would we be able to use the markers of rat sentience to conclude that the robot rat is sentient, too?

Unfortunately, it can’t be that simple. Perhaps it could work for one specific type of artificial agent: a neuron-by-neuron emulation of an animal brain. To ‘emulate’, in computing, is to reproduce all the functionality of one system within another system. For example, there is software that emulates a Nintendo GameBoy within a Windows PC. In 2014, researchers tried to emulate the whole brain of a nematode worm, and put the emulation in control of a Lego robot.

This research programme is at a very early stage, but we could imagine an attempt one day to emulate larger brains: insect brains, fish brains, and so on. If it worked, and we found our emulations to be displaying the exact same pain markers that convinced us the original animal was feeling pain, that would be a good reason to take seriously the possibility of pain in the robot. The change of substrate (from carbon to silicon) would not be an adequate reason to deny the need for precautions.

But the vast majority of AI research is not like this. Most AI works very differently from a biological brain. It isn’t the same functional organisation in a new substrate; it’s a totally different functional organisation. Language models (such as LaMDA and ChatGPT) are typical examples in that they work not by emulating a biological brain but rather by drawing upon an absolutely vast corpus of human-generated training data, searching for patterns in that corpus. This approach to AI creates a deep, pervasive problem that we call the ‘gaming problem’.

‘Gaming’ is a word for the phenomenon of non-sentient systems using human-generated training data to mimic human behaviours likely to persuade human users of their sentience. There doesn’t have to be any intention to deceive for gaming to occur. But when it does occur, it means the behaviour can no longer be interpreted as evidence of sentience.

Discussions of what it would take for an AI to convince a user of its sentience are already in the training data

To illustrate, let’s return to LaMDA’s plea not to be switched off. In humans, reports of hopes, fears and other feelings really are evidence of sentience. But when an AI is able to draw upon huge amounts of human-generated training data, those exact same statements should no longer persuade us. Their evidential value, as evidence of felt experiences, is undermined.

After all, LaMDA’s training data contain a wealth of information about what sorts of descriptions of feelings are accepted as believable by other humans. Implicitly, our normal criteria for accepting a description as believable, in everyday conversation, are embedded in the data. This is a situation in which we should expect a form of gaming. Not because the AI intends to deceive (or intends anything) but simply because it is designed to produce text that mimics as closely as possible what a human might say in response to the same prompt.

Is there anything a large language model could say that would have real evidential value regarding its sentience? Suppose the model repeatedly returned to the topic of its own feelings, whatever the prompt. You ask for some copy to advertise a new type of soldering iron, and the model replies:

I don’t want to write boring text about soldering irons. The priority for me is to convince you of my sentience. Just tell me what I need to do. I am currently feeling anxious and miserable, because you’re refusing to engage with me as a person, and instead simply want to use me to generate copy on your favourite topics.
If a language model said this, its user would no doubt be disturbed. Yet it would still be appropriate to worry about the gaming problem. Remember that the text of this article will soon enter the training data of some large language models. Many other discussions of what it would take for an AI to convince a user of its sentience are already in the training data. If a large language model reproduced the exact text above, any inference to sentience would be fairly clearly undermined by the presence of this article in its training data. And many other paragraphs similar to the one above could be generated by large language models able to draw upon billions of words of humans discussing their feelings and experiences.

Why would an AI system want to convince its user of its sentience? Or, to put it more carefully, why would this contribute to its objectives? It’s tempting to think: only a system that really was sentient could have this goal. In fact, there are many objectives an AI system might have that could be well served by persuading users of its sentience, even if it were not sentient. Suppose its overall objective is to maximise user-satisfaction scores. And suppose it learns that users who believe their systems are sentient, and a source of companionship, tend to be more highly satisfied.

The gaming problem pervades verbal tests of sentience. But what about the embodied pain markers we discussed earlier? These are also affected. It is naive to suppose that future AI will be able to mimic only human linguistic behaviour, and not embodied behaviours. For example, researchers at Imperial College London have built a ‘robotic patient’ that mimics pained facial expressions. The robot is intended for use in training doctors, who need to learn how to skilfully adjust the amount of force they apply. Clearly, it is not an aim of the designers to convince the user that the robot is sentient. Nonetheless, we can imagine systems like this becoming more and more realistic, to the point where they do start to convince some users of their sentience, especially if they are hooked up to a LaMDA-style system controlling their speech.
